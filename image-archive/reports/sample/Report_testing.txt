---------------------------- Radiological Report ----------------------------------

INDICATION:  Follow-up.

FINDINGS:  Comparison is made with the most recent study dated 11/16/1995. 

The endotracheal tube, mediastinal drain and sternotomy wires are unchanged since the previous examination.

The study is obtained with the patient slightly rotated.  Accounting for this, the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  

The 16-11-1995 previous right upper lobe and left lower lobe opacity, has slightly decreased since the previous examination.  The opacities within the left upper and right middle lobe persist.  Bilateral pleural effusions are again demonstrated unchanged.  

The pulmonary vasculature is 16-11-95 asymmetric with the left being less than 11/16/95 the right, however, this is unchanged since the previous examination.

IMPRESSION:  Mild interval improvement in the right upper lobe opacity and left lower lobe opacity.  Persistence of the right middle and left upper lobe opacity.  These findings are compatible with atelectasis and consolidation.
