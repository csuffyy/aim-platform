d: 1980-06-28

Compared to prior from June 16 through June 26. 

CLINICAL HISTORY:  2 week old female for follow up of right upper lobe collapse. 

FINDINGS:  Again there is evidence of dextrocardia and abnormal situs, likely situs inversus.  There is an NG tube that remains in position.  There is persistent right upper lobe collapse with compensatory hyperinflation of the left lung and mild left to right mediastinal shift.  On the subsequent film from August 18, there is some improved aeration of the right upper lung, but it has not completely reinflated.  The left lung remains clear.  

OPINION:  Partial resolution of right upper lobe collapse.
